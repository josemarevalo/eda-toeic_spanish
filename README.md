# Languages Skill: TOEIC vs Spanish Enrolment Score


This Data Analysis project explores a dataset of 2000 enrolment scores from a spanish-speaking university, including results for the English Test undertaken by that particular Faculty. I used RStudio to explore how English and Spanish scores were related, as well as the respective high school attributes. As a result, I found out that there was a positive correlation, suggesting the potential existence of a “languages skill” in the brain.


## Data source

A dataset containing the results for the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC), results for the Chilean Higher Education Selection Exam (PSU) as well as other attributes of almost 2,000 new enrollments. This has been collected with the approval and consent of the Studies Secretary from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Chile.
